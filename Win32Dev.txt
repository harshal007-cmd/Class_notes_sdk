1. Identifire names must begin with small case letter of data type.
2. If varible name with multiple words, 1st letter should be capital.
3 Identifire must be meaningfull, and if necessary can me made up of multiple words. 
4. Follow the name of conventions which is using from generations.

WNDCLASSEX,MSG- struct
UINT-unsign int
CS_HREDRAW (all capital and '_')= macro

****Steps to create Window(gui)

1.Initialize WNDCLASS or WNDCLASSEX structure\
-a. Specify Style of window
-b. specity extra info about Window or Window class if any.
-c. Specify callback funtion.
-d. Specity instance handle.
-e. specify background brush handle, icon handle, small icon handle, cusrser handle if any.
-f. Specify menu name if any. 
-e. Specify your custom window class name(MUST kara he).

2. Register this class to WindowOS
3. Create window in memory.
4. Show the window on desktop.
5. Draw\redraw\paint\repaint client area of window.
6. Start life of application by message loop in which:
-a. get your window's messages from OS
-b. translate them to lower level message as needed.
-c. dispatch them to WndProg.
7. Inside wndprog:
-a. Write message handlers of those message in which is intrested.
-b. leave or passon the messages to OS.
-c. when done means user closes window leave message loop(come out of it) and return from WinMain.

#In all GUI based application (must be these 4 steps)
1.entry point funtion
2.message loop
3.window
4.callback funtion

#Callback\Reentrent funtion rules

1. You cannot decide no. and types of parameters.
2. Its must have OS decided return value, not user's return value.
3. Calling conventions must have OS decided. 	
4. It must be declared globally, so that you, program and OS will keep in far segment.
5. Only OS will call it, not you.

1)WinMain is typedef
=__WinMainCRTStarup
=__mainCRTStartup()
=__main()
=main()
CTR- C run time

2)HINSTANCE or any thing that start with h =HANDLE,UINT, unsign int
DBMI- Dos protected mode interface (fake mode by WindowsOS) for multitasking in WindowsOS.

CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW= CS-Class style
GetStockObject its return is HGDIOBJ(handle to graphic defice interface object)
